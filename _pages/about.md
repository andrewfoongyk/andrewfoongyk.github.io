I am a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=andrew-foong-yue-kwang) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Professor Richard E. Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/), and advised by [Dr. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). I started my PhD in October 2018. My research focuses on the intersection of probabilistic modelling and deep learning, with work on Bayesian neural networks, meta-learning, and modelling equivariance.

I received my BA and MEng in Information and Computer Engineering (first class honours with distinction) from the University of Cambridge in 2018. My PhD studies are funded by a Trinity Hall Research Studentship and a George and Lilian Schiff Studentship.

You can find a list of selected publications [here](./publications.md). For a full overview, see my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UOjgIUAAAAJ&hl=en).
