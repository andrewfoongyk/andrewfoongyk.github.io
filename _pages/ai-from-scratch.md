<h1>Understanding AI from Scratch</h1>

<p>
This six-part lecture series was delivered to the Mayo Clinic Department of Radiation Oncology to help clinicians understand the core concepts of AI, from linear regression models to modern systems like ChatGPT.
</p>

<p>
The series assumes no prior background in AI and uses clinical examples throughout.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lectures 1 & 2:</strong> Deep Learning from the Ground Up — from linear regression and gradient descent to neural networks, overfitting, and generalization.</li>
  <li><strong>Lectures 3 & 4:</strong> Medical Imaging & Convolutional Networks — how deep learning processes images and powers medical AI.</li>
  <li><strong>Lectures 5 & 6:</strong> Large Language Models & Prompting — how ChatGPT works and how to use techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).</li>
</ul>
