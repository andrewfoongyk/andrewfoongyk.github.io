excerpt: "Neural Processes are a powerful framework for learning from small datasets in the presence of uncertainty. This work adds convolutional structure to the Neural Process family. Together with my co-authors [Yann Dubois](https://yanndubs.github.io/about/) and [Jonathan Gordon](https://gordonjo.github.io/), we wrote a [blog explaining what Neural Processes are](https://yanndubs.github.io/Neural-Process-Family/text/Intro.html). It also includes code to run many different Neural Process models."

## Abstract
We introduce the Convolutional Conditional Neural Process (ConvCNP), a new member of the Neural Process family that models translation equivariance in the data. Translation equivariance is an important inductive bias for many learning problems including time series modeling, spatial data, and images. The model embeds data sets into an infinite-dimensional function space as opposed to a finite-dimensional vector space. To formalize this notion, we extend the theory of neural representations of sets to include functional representations, and demonstrate that any translation-equivariant embedding can be represented using a convolutional deep set. We evaluate ConvCNPs in several settings, demonstrating that they achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing NPs. We demonstrate that building in translation equivariance enables zero-shot generalization to challenging, out-of-domain tasks.
